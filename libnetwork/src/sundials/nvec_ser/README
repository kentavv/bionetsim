                     NVECTOR_SERIAL
                Release 2.0, November 2004          

Serial implementation of the NVECTOR module for SUNDIALS. 

NVECTOR_SERIAL defines the content field of N_Vector to be a structure 
containing the length of the vector, a pointer to the beginning of a 
contiguous data array, and a boolean flag indicating ownership of the 
data array.

NVECTOR_SERIAL defines five macros to provide access to the content of 
a serial N_Vector, several constructors for variables of type N_Vector,
a constructor for an array of variables of type N_Vector, and destructors
for N_Vector and N_Vector array.

NVECTOR_SERIAL provides implementations for all vector operations defined
by the generic NVECTOR module in the table of operations.

A. Documentation
----------------

The serial NVECTOR implementation is fully described in the user documentation 
for any of the SUNDIALS solvers [1,2,3,4]. PostScript and PDF files for the user
guide for a particular solver are available in the solver's directory.

B. Installation
---------------

For basic installation instructions see /sundials/INSTALL. 
For complete installation instructions see any of the user guides.

D.1. Revision history since release 1.0 (July 2002)
---------------------------------------------------

- Revised to correspond to new generic NVECTOR module
  (see sundials/shared/README).
- Extended the list of user-callable functions provided by NVECTOR_SERIAL
  outside the table of vector operations.
- Revised the F/C interface to use underscore flags for name mapping
  and to use precision flag from configure.
- Revised F/C routine NVECTOR names for uniformity.
